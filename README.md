# Mixtasks 

A collection of reusable Mix Tasks.  

This repo contains a number of Elixir projects.  Each project contains mix
tasks, focused on a specific purpose.

To use, add the project as a dependency:

    {:ash_gen, github: "andyl/mixtasks", sparse: "ash_gen"}, 
    {:ecto_util, github: "andyl/mixtasks", sparse: "ecto_util"}, 

See the (mix
documentation)[https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.14/Mix.Tasks.Deps.html#module-git-options-git]
for more info.

Next Steps: 
- [ ] Copy injectors from phoenix project 
- [ ] Test injector environment variable 
- [ ] Build first operations using injectors
